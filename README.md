## About me

After over a decade in the Service Industry, I decided to pursue a career in Software Development. I got the opportunity to go back to school at Ivy Tech Community College in 2020 for a Certificate in Web Application Development. I jumped at the chance to connect my love of technology and my passion for solving puzzles. After successfully completing that set of courses as a Summa Cum Laude graduate, I decided to continue to build on my newly found skills. I joined an Apprenticeship with Nashville Software School in November of 2021 to enhance my ability to not only learn new languages, but to learn to work as a team in a simulated work environment. 



## Team Skills 
* Working on projects using Git/GitHub
* Pushing, pulling, and merging code to complete more complicated projects
* Creating more informative pull requests to communicate efficiently in a team setting
* Knowing when to ask for help
* Helping my teammates work through a new concept to reinforce my own knowledge on the material I have learned
* Pair and Mob Programming to work through new concepts
* Getting a better understanding of error handling by encountering code I may not have written personally
* Learning to read and understand new code effectively
